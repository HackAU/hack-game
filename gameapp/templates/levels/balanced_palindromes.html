<h1>Balanced Palindromes</h1>

<p> We define a balanced sequence of parenthesis as follows:</p>
<p>- Empty string is a balanced sequence of parenthesis.</p>
<p>- If a and b are perfectly balanced parenthesis, so is (a)b.</p>
<br>
<p>A palindrome is such a string that it's equal to its reversed. Note that empty string is a palindrome.</p>

<p>Calculate the number of strings of length up to 16 (inclusive), that are both a balanced sequence of parenthesis and a palindrome.</p>
